# 🚀 System Integration and Architecture: The Ultimate Code Quest 🎯

Welcome, brave 4th-year IT adventurers! You've stumbled upon the sacred repository that holds the keys to completing your journey through **System Integration and Architecture**. Behold the glory of structure, organization, and—you guessed it—code.

## 🌟 What's Inside?
This repository is your digital playground, containing:
- 🛠 **Laboratory Exercises**: Weekly coding missions to sharpen your integration ninja skills. 💻
- 💎 **Final Project**: A masterpiece that will make recruiters shout, *"We need this genius in our company NOW!"*

Everything is neatly tucked away using a meticulous directory structure because...we’re professionals like that:

### Directory Structure
📂 Main 
📂 Tags 
📂 Branches 
├── [Your Name Here]/ 
    ├── LAB-[LaboratoryDate: yyyymmdd]/ 
    └── final-project/


### Example:
📂 Branches 
├── JTIDelaCruz/ 
    ├── LAB-20250308/ 
    └── final-project/

### Naming Conventions:
1. Each student must create their own GitHub branch using the naming convention:
   **[First Name Initial][Middle Initial][Last Name]**
   _(E.g., `JTIDelaCruz` for Juan Tamad Inantok Dela Cruz)._

2. **Laboratory Submissions**:
   - Inside your branch, create a new folder for each laboratory session with the format:
     **`LAB-[yyyymmdd]`**
     _(E.g., `LAB-20250308` for the lab session on March 8, 2025)._

3. **Final Project Submission**:
   - Your final project should be added inside the `final-project/` folder within your branch. 
   - Use a separate branch name for project submission, as instructed later in the course.
